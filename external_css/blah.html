<p>SPOILERS AHEAD FOR DR. STRANGELOVE!!!</p>
  
<h2>Major Characters</h2>
  
<p>Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper is the commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, he is responsible for ordering the bombers situated 2 hours away from their target. He also has this weird thing with precious bodily essence and fluoridation, I think he's homosexual and in super deep denial because he says some stuff about stuff and y'know, no shame in that, but ending the world to fit into preconceived notions of masculinity is kind of not cool.</p>
  
<p class="fancy">President Merkin Muffley is the sitting president of the United States of America, he's generally a bit of an oaf and his conversations with the Soviet Premier over the phone are hilarious.</p>
  
<p>Major Kong is the commander of the bomber followed in one of the movie's three plotlines. He's a cowboy caricature and apparently his actor wasn't told it was a black comedy while they were making the movie so he would play it straight. He's also well known for the scene near the end of the movie where he rides the bomb on its way down.</p>
